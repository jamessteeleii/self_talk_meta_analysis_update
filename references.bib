  abstract = {Empirical literature addressing the effectiveness of self-talk for expert performers is lacking. We addressed this shortcoming within the existent literature and examined the comparative effects of instructional and motivational self-talk on basketball free throw shooting accuracy and salient movement kinematics. We recruited 20 professional basketball players to participate in a 2\,\texttimes\,2 pre/post-test experiment. Free throw accuracy and movement patterns were recorded, with the latter subsequently used to calculate elbow\textendash wrist coordination variability. Results indicated superior shooting accuracy and reduced movement coordination variability for instructional self-talk compared to baseline conditions, whereas no differences emerged for motivational self-talk. Findings from the study help practitioners to better guide skilled performers how best to use self-talk; an area in urgent need of further research.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Unpleasant physical sensations during maximal exercise may manifest themselves as negative cognitions that impair performance, alter pacing, and are linked to increased rating of perceived exertion (RPE). This study examined whether motivational self-talk (M-ST) could reduce RPE and change pacing strategy, thereby enhancing 10-km time-trial (TT) cycling performance in contrast to neutral self-talk (N-ST). METHODS: Fourteen men undertook 4 TTs, TT1-TT4. After TT2, participants were matched into groups based on TT2 completion time and underwent M-ST (n=7) or N-ST (n=7) after TT3. Performance, power output, RPE, and oxygen uptake (VO2) were compared across 1-km segments using ANOVA. Confidence intervals (95\%CI) were calculated for performance data. RESULTS: After TT3 (ie, before intervention), completion times were not different between groups (M-ST, 1120{$\pm$}113 s; N-ST, 1150{$\pm$}110 s). After M-ST, TT4 completion time was faster (1078{$\pm$}96 s); the N-ST remained similar (1165{$\pm$}111 s). The M-ST group achieved this through a higher power output and VO2 in TT4 (6th-10th km). RPE was unchanged. CI data indicated the likely true performance effect lay between 13- and 71-s improvement (TT4 vs TT3). CONCLUSION: M-ST improved endurance performance and enabled a higher power output, whereas N-ST induced no change. The VO2 response matched the increase in power output, yet RPE was unchanged, thereby inferring a perceptual benefit through M-ST. The valence and content of self-talk are important determinants of the efficacy of this intervention. These findings are primarily discussed in the context of the psychobiological model of pacing.},

Design: One between-groups factor with four levels (instructional, motivational, no self-talk, neutral self-talk) and one within-groups ``time'' factor with two levels (pre-test, post-test). Method: 35 men and 25 women physically active and knee injured following meniscectomy 6 months ago participated. After 2 days of familiarization, they completed four dynamic balance stability trials, spaced 3 min apart. After the first two trials (best value as pre-test score), the participants were randomly assigned to four groups: the motivational self-talk group, instructional self-talk group and control groups (no instruction and neutral self-talk). They repeated the two trials (best value as post-test score) expressing aloud the phrases assigned. Results: Analysis of variance repeated-measures and Sidak multiple comparisons tests were performed on the time variable to detect differences in each group for each time point (pre- and post-test). Statistical analysis showed that balance board time score increased significantly only for experimental groups after the intervention period and not for control groups, F(3,56) = 9.93, p {$<$} 0.05, {$\eta$}2 = 0.861 for time of keeping stability on the board. Conclusions: The findings of the present study indicate that injured active individuals with meniscectomy may enhance their balance test performance via the use of instructional and motivational self-talk.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The psychobiological model of endurance performance proposes that the perception of effort is the ultimate determinant of endurance performance. Therefore, any physiological or psychological factor affecting the perception of effort will affect endurance performance. Accordingly, this novel study investigated the effects of a frequently used psychological strategy, motivational self-talk (ST), on RPE and endurance performance. METHODS: In a randomized between-group pretest-posttest design, 24 participants (mean {$\pm$} SD age = 24.6 {$\pm$} 7.5 yr, VO2max = 52.3 {$\pm$} 8.7 mL{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min) performed two constant-load (80\% peak power output) cycling time-to-exhaustion (TTE) tests, punctuated by a 2-wk ST intervention or a control phase. RESULTS: A group (ST vs Control) \texttimes{} test (pretest vs posttest) mixed-model ANOVA revealed that ST significantly enhanced TTE test from pretest to posttest (637 {$\pm$} 210 vs 750 {$\pm$} 295 s, P {$<$} 0.05) with no change in the control group (486 {$\pm$} 157 vs 474 {$\pm$} 169 s). Moreover, a group \texttimes{} test \texttimes{} isotime (0\%, 50\%, and 100\%) mixed-model ANOVA revealed a significant interaction for RPE, with follow-up tests showing that motivational self-talk significantly reduced RPE at 50\% isotime (7.3 {$\pm$} 0.6 vs 6.4 {$\pm$} 0.8, P {$<$} 0.05), with no significant difference in the control group (6.9 {$\pm$} 1.9 vs 7.0 {$\pm$} 1.7). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate that ST significantly reduces RPE and enhances endurance performance. The findings support the psychobiological model of endurance performance and illustrate that psychobiological interventions designed to specifically target favorable changes in the perception of effort are beneficial to endurance performance. Consequently, this psychobiological model offers an important and novel perspective for future research investigations.},

  abstract = {In sports, athletes might train or compete with some degree of mental fatigue that has an impact on performance. The present study investigated the effect of strategic motivational self-talk on endurance performance in mentally fatigued individuals. Twelve healthy men performed three cycling endurance tests at 80\% peak power output until exhaustion. Two experimental conditions (mental fatigue [MF] and mental fatigue plus motivational self-talk [MF + M-ST]) and a control condition (CO) were set out. Mental fatigue was induced via 30 min Stroop task; an electroencephalogram of the frontal cerebral cortex was continually monitored. Affective state and perceived exertion were recorded during each session and subjective workload after the endurance exercise trials. Theta band power spectral density was significantly higher in both experimental condition (MF and MF + M-ST) compared to CO, without significant differences between MF and MF + M-ST. Endurance performance was significantly worse in MF (227 {$\pm$} 63s) than in CO (329 {$\pm$} 84s). However, motivational self-talk reversed the deleterious effect of MF on endurance performance as in MF + M-ST (368 {$\pm$} 139s) it was significantly better than MF and not significantly different from CO. Displeasure and perceived exertion scores were similar at the end of exercise and presented similar rate of increase among conditions. Mental demand after exercise was significantly greater in MF than in CO condition. These results suggest that motivational self-talk mitigates the negative effect of MF on endurance performance due to an elevated engagement with the task. Lay summary: This study examined to what extent the deliberate and planned use of cue words to enhance motivation (i.e., motivational self-talk), influenced endurance performance in mentally fatigued individuals. The harmful impact of mental fatigue on endurance performance was mitigated by using motivational self-talk during cycling exercise. Strategic motivational self-talk can be used to mitigate the harmful effect of mental fatigue effect on endurance performance.Motivational self-talk can be used to slow down the athletes' perceived exertion and the feeling of displeasure during high-intensity endurance training and competitions.}

Methods Forty-two senior high students (mean age~=~17.48~{$\pm~$}0.55) were instructed to use instructional, motivational, and unrelated self-talk with counterbalanced order prior to softball throwing for accuracy and distance tasks. Results Both instructional and motivational self-talk conditions had better performance than unrelated self-talk on softball throwing accuracy, whereas motivational self-talk had better performance than both instructional and unrelated self-talk in softball throwing for distance. Results for self-efficacy were similar, with self-efficacy for accuracy performance higher in both instructional and motivational self-talk conditions than with unrelated self-talk, while self-efficacy was highest in the motivational self-talk condition and lowest with unrelated self-talk. Significant correlations between self-efficacy and motor performance were also found with both tasks. Conclusion These findings partially support the task-matching hypothesis, confirm the moderator role of type of self-talk and task type, suggest that self-efficacy has a mediator role, and provide direction for self-talk effectiveness.},

Structural equation modeling (SEM) and meta-analysis are two powerful statistical methods in the educational, social, behavioral, and medical sciences. They are often treated as two unrelated topics in the literature. This book presents a unified framework on analyzing meta-analytic data within the SEM framework, and illustrates how to conduct meta-analysis using the metaSEM package in the R statistical environment. Meta-Analysis: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach begins by introducing the importance of SEM and meta-analysis in answering research questions. Key ideas in meta-analysis and SEM are briefly reviewed, and various meta-analytic models are then introduced and linked to the SEM framework. Fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models in univariate and multivariate meta-analyses, three-level meta-analysis, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling, are introduced. Advanced topics, such as using restricted maximum likelihood estimation method and handling missing covariates, are also covered. Readers will learn a single framework to apply both meta-analysis and SEM. Examples in R and in Mplus are included.  This book will be a valuable resource for statistical and academic researchers and graduate students carrying out meta-analyses, and will also be useful to researchers and statisticians using SEM in biostatistics. Basic knowledge of either SEM or meta-analysis will be helpful in understanding the materials in this book.},

  abstract = {Background ``Cumulative meta-analysis'' describes a statistical procedure to calculate, retrospectively, summary estimates from the results of similar trials every time the results of a further trial in the series had become available. In the early 1990s, comparisons of cumulative meta-analyses of treatments for myocardial infarction with advice promulgated through medical textbooks showed that research had continued long after robust estimates of treatment effects had accumulated, and that medical textbooks had overlooked strong, existing evidence from trials. Cumulative meta-analyses have subsequently been used to assess what could have been known had new studies been informed by systematic reviews of relevant existing evidence and how waste might have been reduced. Methods and Findings We used a systematic approach to identify and summarise the findings of cumulative meta-analyses of studies of the effects of clinical interventions, published from 1992 to 2012. Searches were done of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Methodology Register and Science Citation Index. A total of 50 eligible reports were identified, including more than 1,500 cumulative meta-analyses. A variety of themes are illustrated with specific examples. The studies showed that initially positive results became null or negative in meta-analyses as more trials were done; that early null or negative results were over-turned; that stable results (beneficial, harmful and neutral) would have been seen had a meta-analysis been done before the new trial; and that additional trials had been much too small to resolve the remaining uncertainties. Conclusions This large, unique collection of cumulative meta-analyses highlights how a review of the existing evidence might have helped researchers, practitioners, patients and funders make more informed decisions and choices about new trials over decades of research. This would have led to earlier uptake of effective interventions in practice, less exposure of trial participants to less effective treatments, and reduced waste resulting from unjustified research.},

To this purpose, we designed a parallel two groups, randomised, longitudinal (pre- and post-test) study. During 12 days in all exercise-training sessions, the motivational self-talk (M-ST) group (n = 10) was asked to rehearse motivational sentences driving to improve effort to finish the swimming test (750 m) as fast as they could. The instructional self-talk (I-ST) group (n = 11) was asked to rehearse sentences driven to keep pace and movement fluency. The performance in the swimming test increased significantly only in the M-ST group from pre- to post-intervention (2.8\%, {$\eta$}p2=.55). In addition, only the M-ST group increased significantly the swimming pace ({$\eta$}p2=.52), which was measured every 150 m, and maintained the same perception of effort level when comparing pre- and post-intervention. The M-ST group also increased significantly their outcome expectancy (6\%, {$\eta$}p2= .34) from pre- to post-intervention, in which the variance of swimming performance was approximately 60\% explained by the outcome expectancy (B = .656, SE = .086, p {$<$} .001, 95\% CI [.482, .830]). Findings suggest that M-ST enhanced outcome expectancy, helping triathletes to improve endurance performance probably due to the higher level of potential motivation which mobilised more effort. Therefore, M-ST intervention has been probably effective to improve swimming endurance performance in amateur triathletes, whereas I-ST has maintained it.},

The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the effects of self-talk strategies on different attention functions, namely, alertness, vigilance, focused, selective, divided, and spatial attention. A between-subjects experimental design was adopted. Six experiments were conducted involving 255 (130 males and 125 females) participants (mean age 21.17 {$\pm$} 2.31), assigned into experimental and control groups. A five-session protocol was implemented including baseline testing, training intervention, and final assessment. The Test Battery for Perception and Attention Functions from the Vienna Test System was used to assess attention functions. The analysis showed that in all experiments, in 14 out of 17 tests, the experimental groups had faster reaction times than the control groups, and a meta-analytic synthesis of the results showed a large effect size (d = 0.75). The findings suggest that self-talk benefit the attention functions and support postulations for an attentional interpretation of the facilitating effects of self-talk strategies on task performance.},

  abstract = {In the sport literature, strategic self-talk has been shown to improve task performance, and these effects have been partly attributed to enhanced attention. Furthermore, research has shown that strategic instructional self-talk can help counter the adverse effects of ego depletion on attention tasks. Extending this line of research, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of strategic instructional self-talk on a divided attention task following physical exhaustion. Participants of 60 undergraduate students with a mean age of 20.23 years were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. Following a short familiarisation with task procedures, participants were induced into a state of physical exhaustion through a running protocol on a treadmill. Immediately after the conclusion of the physical task, they performed the divided attention test on the Vienna Test System, during which participants of the experimental group were instructed to use strategic intructional self-talk cues. The analysis of the final assessment showed that the self-talk group had a higher percentage of correct responses and faster reaction times than the control group. The results of this study suggest that strategic instructional self-talk can help counter the potentially negative consequences of physical exhaustion on attention. The findings provide further support for an attentional interpretation of self-talk effectiveness, suggesting that improvements in attention functions can be a plausible mechanism for explaining the facilitative effects of self-talk on task performance.},

In the field experiment, 28 female basketball players (Mage 20.96{$\pm$}4.51 years) were tested on free-throwing, following a baseline assessment and a six-week intervention. In both settings the final assessment took place under conditions of external distraction (noncontinuous, sudden, loud noise).

Findings suggest that self-talk can counter the effects of distraction on performance, and indicate that the attentional effects of self-talk is a viable mechanism to explain the facilitating effects of self-talk on performance.},

  abstract = {People talk not only to others but also to themselves. The self talk we engage in may be overt or covert, and is associated with a variety of higher mental functions, including reasoning, problem solving, planning and plan execution, attention, and motivation. When talking to herself, a speaker takes devices from her mother tongue, originally designed for interpersonal communication, and employs them to communicate with herself. But what could it even mean to communicate with oneself? To answer that question, we need a theory of communication that explains how the same linguistic devices may be used to communicate with others and oneself. On the received view, which defines communication as information exchange, self talk appears to be an anomaly, for it is hard to see the point of exchanging information with oneself. However, if communication is analysed as a way of negotiating commitments between speaker and hearer, then communication may be useful even when speaker and hearer coincide. Thus a commitment-based approach allows us to make sense of self talk as well as social talk.},

In Part I, I provide an overview of the basic principles of meta-analysis and direct readers to accessible, non-technical treatments of the topic. In Part II, I introduce several key issues in meta-analysis and summarize the latest advances in each: effective assessment of heterogeneity; testing for moderators; dealing with dependency; evaluating publication bias and tracking down `fugitive literature'; and assessing sample size in meta-analysis. I also cover two emerging topics: testing theories using meta-analysis and open science and transparency practices in meta-analysis. I conclude the discussion of each issue by providing best practice guidelines, and refer the reader to further accessible texts to augment knowledge and understanding.},

A total of 32 studies yielding 62 effect sizes were included in the final meta-analytic pool. The analysis revealed a positive moderate effect size (ES = .48). The moderator analyses showed that self-talk interventions were more effective for tasks involving relatively fine, compared with relatively gross, motor demands, and for novel, compared with well-learned, tasks. Instructional self-talk was more effective for fine tasks than was motivational self-talk; moreover, instructional self-talk was more effective for fine tasks rather than gross tasks. Finally, interventions including self-talk training were more effective than those not including self-talk training. The results of this study establish the effectiveness of self-talk in sport, encourage the use of self-talk as a strategy to facilitate learning and enhance performance, and provide new research directions.},

A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of `set shifting' ability in people with eating disorders.},

Method Participants were 54 fifth and sixth grade students who were randomly assigned to two experimental groups (instructional self-talk, motivational self-talk) and one control group. Students were pre-tested in a chest pass and in a modified push-ups test, were instructed to use the respective self-talk type and were post-tested in the two tests. Results Results showed that both self-talk groups surpassed control group in both tasks. Instructional and motivational self-talk were equally effective in the chest pass test, but motivational self-talk was more effective compared to instructional self-talk in the modified push-ups test.

  abstract = {In conjunction with BBC Lab UK, the present study developed 12 brief psychological skill interventions for online delivery. A protocol was designed that captured data via self-report measures, used video recordings to deliver interventions, involved a competitive concentration task against an individually matched computer opponent, and provided feedback on the effects of the interventions. Three psychological skills were used; imagery, self-talk, and if-then planning, with each skill directed to one of four different foci: outcome goal, process goal, instruction, or arousal-control. This resulted in 12 different intervention participant groups (randomly assigned) with a 13th group acting as a control. Participants (n = 44,742) completed a competitive task four times\textemdash practice, baseline, following an intervention, and again after repeating the intervention. Results revealed performance improved following practice with incremental effects for imagery-outcome, imagery-process, and self-talk-outcome and self-talk-process over the control group, with the same interventions increasing the intensity of effort invested, arousal and pleasant emotion. Arousal-control interventions associated with pleasant emotions, low arousal, and low effort invested in performance. Instructional interventions were not effective. Results offer support for the utility of online interventions in teaching psychological skills and suggest brief interventions that focus on increasing motivation, increased arousal, effort invested, and pleasant emotions were the most effective.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a strategy that combined self talk and performance feedback. Therefore, three groups of adult tennis players performed a forehand groundstroke task. The first group (n = 16) applied an instructional self talk and self feedback combination, the second (n = 16) used regular instructional self talk, and the third (n = 16) performed without any specific aid. The hypothesis was that the performance and concentration scores of both self talk groups would improve from the pretest to the posttest, while the scores from the control group would remain unchanged. The analysis of variance with repeated measures confirmed this hypothesis. Further, the players who used self feedback perceived the effectiveness of their intervention to be significantly higher compared with the other intervention group. Overall, the combination of self talk and feedback seems to be an alternative to the original instructional self talk intervention.},

A comprehensive research review was conducted, including 559 self-talk articles published between 1978 and 2020. These articles were divided into 6 research categories: (a) inner dialogue, (b) mixed spontaneous and goal-directed organic self-talk, (c) goal-directed self-talk, (d) spontaneous self-talk, (e) educational self-talk interventions, and (f) strategic self-talk interventions. Following this, critical details were extracted from a subsample of 100 articles to create an interdisciplinary synthesis of the self-talk literature. Based on the synthesis, a self-talk model was created that places spontaneous and goal-directed organic self-talk as well as educational and strategic self-talk interventions in relation to variables within their nomological network, including external factors (e.g. task difficulty), descriptive states and traits (e.g. emotions), behaviour and performance, metacognition, and psychological skills (e.g. concentration).},

The rapid development of the self-talk literature in sport since then has bred the need to rethink how self-talk is conceptualized. The purpose of the present article was 2-fold: (a) to review how conceptualizations of self-talk and the associated research perspectives have changed during the past decade and (b) to introduce a new integrative conceptualization of sport self-talk. We identify 2 main developments that alter our view of what self-talk is, reinforcing the need for a new conceptualization: the identification of 2 distinct self-talk entities (organic self-talk and strategic self-talk) and the distinctions between spontaneous and goal-directed self-talk, as these emerged within organic self-talk. Consequently, we propose a new integrative conceptualization of self-talk. We believe that for such a conceptualization to be sufficient so as to guide future research, several attributes of self-talk ought to be recognized: the necessary and sufficient attributes that define self-talk and important descriptive attributes, including overtness, interpretation, origins, and functions, which facilitate the understanding and the study of the self-talk phenomena.

In this study, 46 male participants (Mage = 21.4, SD = 1.72 years) with high mindfulness (n = 23) and low mindfulness (n = 23) performed dart-throwing and two-hand coordination tasks under pressure and non-pressure conditions and when using instructional and unrelated self-talk. First, on the two-hand coordination task, a three-way mixed ANOVA found: (a) a significant 3-way interaction in which a significantly poorer performance occurred under pressure (vs. without pressure), with low (vs. high) mindfulness and when using unrelated (vs. instructional) self-talk and (b) a significant interaction in which, both under pressure and not, both high and low mindfulness participants performed comparably when using instructional (vs. unrelated) self-talk. Second, on the dart-throwing task, mindfulness interacted with self-talk such that both high and low mindfulness participants performed better when using instructional self-talk, and pressure interacted with self-talk such that participants using instructional (vs. unrelated) self-talk performed better in both pressure and non-pressure conditions. We concluded that instructional self-talk was a useful cognitive strategy, perhaps particularly in pressure conditions and regardless of the degree of mindfulness, and its effectiveness extended to two different motor tasks. We discussed the theoretical implications of these findings, in terms of attention theory, self-talk, and motor control; and we highlighted our study's limitations and practical applications and gave recommendations for future research.},

An enduring goal since inception has been to understand how psychological techniques can improve athletic performance. Although much evidence exists in the form of meta-analytic reviews related to sport psychology and performance, a systematic review of these meta-analyses is absent from the literature. We aimed to synthesize the extant literature to gain insights into the overall impact of sport psychology on athletic performance. Guided by the PRISMA statement for systematic reviews, we reviewed relevant articles identified via the EBSCOhost interface. Thirty meta-analyses published between 1983 and 2021 met the inclusion criteria, covering 16 distinct sport psychology constructs. Overall, sport psychology interventions/variables hypothesized to enhance performance (e.g., cohesion, confidence, mindfulness) were shown to have a moderate beneficial effect (d = 0.51), whereas variables hypothesized to be detrimental to performance (e.g., cognitive anxiety, depression, ego climate) had a small negative effect (d = -0.21). The quality rating of meta-analyses did not significantly moderate the magnitude of observed effects, nor did the research design (i.e., intervention vs. correlation) of the primary studies included in the meta-analyses. Our review strengthens the evidence base for sport psychology techniques and may be of great practical value to practitioners. We provide recommendations for future research in the area.},

A t-test and magnitude-based inference indicated that motivational self-talk did not affect performance. Nevertheless, follow-up data suggested that most participants found the intervention helpful and continued to use it six months after their research commitment, particularly in endurance events and to a lesser extent in training. Participants continued to use self-talk to cope with exertion, as well as other stressors such as blister discomfort and adverse conditions.

Fifteen young females participated in a within-subject counterbalanced design under control, instructional, and motivational self-talk conditions. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was recorded from active (the right biceps and triceps brachii) and passive (the frontalis and left biceps brachii) muscles during reproduction of the elbow flexion angle (90\textdegree ) in the joint position sense test. The self-talk conditions led to a significantly lower EMG activity of the right biceps muscle, decreased co-contraction ratio of right biceps activity to right triceps activity, and reduced absolute error for the elbow joint position sense compared to the control condition. Also, EMG gradients in the passive muscles were observed in the self-talk conditions but not in the control condition. These findings suggest that attention and motivation are the mechanisms that justify the relationship between self-talk and performance.},

A significantly higher performance improvement was recorded for the self-talk group in post test, whereas when kinematic variables of the motor skill (center of mass displacement) were assessed, ``observational learning'' proved to be more effective.

Studies 1\textendash 3 compared the effects of the self-posed interrogative question (``Will I?'') to declarative (``I will'') and control self-talk, and found no significant group differences in motivation, perceived exertion, or performance. In Studies 4\textendash 5, interrogative, declarative, and control self-talk primes were compared, and no outcome differences were found. In Study 6, the effects of self-talk on motivation, perceived exertion, and physical performance were assessed. The self-talk groups performed better and were more motivated than the control group, but declarative and interrogative groups did not differ from each other. Finally, meta-analyses of the six studies indicated no significant differences among conditions. These results highlight the value of replication and suggest that factors other than grammatical form of self-posed questions may drive the demonstrated relationships between self-talk and performance.},

  abstract = {Objective: Bayesian meta-analyses offer several advantages over traditional approaches, including improved accuracy when using a small number of studies and enhanced estimation of heterogeneity. However, psychological trauma research has yet to see widespread adoption of these statistical methods, potentially due to researchers' unfamiliarity with the processes involved. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical tutorial for conducting random-effects Bayesian meta-analyses. Method: Explanations and recommendations are provided for completing the primary steps of a Bayesian meta-analysis, ranging from model specification to interpretation of results. Furthermore, an illustrative example is used to demonstrate the application of each step. In the example, results are synthesized from six studies included in a previously published systematic review (), with a combined sample size of 21,244,109, examining the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and risk of suicide in veterans and military personnel. Results: The posterior distributions for each model estimate, such as the pooled effect size and the heterogeneity parameter, are discussed and interpreted with regards to the probability of increased suicide risk. Conclusions: Our hope is that this tutorial, along with the provided data and code, facilitate the use of Bayesian meta-analyses in the study of psychological trauma.},

In the common case of only few studies contributing to the meta-analysis, standard approaches to inference tend to perform poorly, and Bayesian meta-analysis has been suggested as a potential solution. The Bayesian approach, however, requires the sensible specification of prior distributions. While noninformative priors are commonly used for the overall mean effect, the use of weakly informative priors has been suggested for the heterogeneity parameter, in particular in the setting of (very) few studies. To date, however, a consensus on how to generally specify a weakly informative heterogeneity prior is lacking. Here we investigate the problem more closely and provide some guidance on prior specification.},

Two 2\,\texttimes\,2 mixed-design analyses of variance were conducted for performance and quiet-eye durations as dependent variables.

"Second-generation questions" regarding potential mediators and moderators of the self-talk-performance relationship were also examined. A total of 47 studies were analyzed. Results indicated beneficial effects of positive, instructional, and motivational self-talk for performance. Somewhat surprisingly, two evidence-based challenges to popular current viewpoints on self-talk emerged. First, negative self-talk did not impede performance. Second, there was inconsistent evidence for the differential effects of instructional and motivational self-talk based on task characteristics. Results from the mediation-based analysis indicate that cognitive and behavioral factors had the most consistent relationships with self-talk. The findings are discussed in the context of recent theoretical advances, and the article includes recommendations for future research (e.g., the use of designs allowing the testing of meditational hypotheses) and for current applied practice (e.g., avoiding the use of thought-stopping techniques).},

  abstract = {The investigation of rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT) in sport settings is growing, but controlled experimental field studies are sparse. In the limited extant literature, researchers have found that irrational (extreme, rigid, and illogical) self-talk leads to disrupted motor skill performance, compared to rational (non-extreme, flexible, and logical) self-talk. However, methodological limitations of past research and the absence of sport-relevant tasks limit the application of findings to athletic settings. Therefore, the current study examined the effects of rational and irrational self-talk on the pressured putting performance of amateur golfers, by adopting a controlled and field-based experimental study design. A two-way repeated-measures ANCOVA, controlling for baseline putting ability, revealed that golfers' putting accuracy was significantly better when using rational self-talk than when using irrational self-talk. In addition, one-samples and paired-samples t-tests showed that golfers reported that rational self-talk was more usable than the irrational self-talk, and perceived the rational self-talk to be more facilitative than the irrational self-talk for their putting performance. The results are discussed with reference to potential explanatory mechanisms, study limitations, and future research needs.},

Extant self-talk models related to self-talk in sport are reviewed and serve as a foundation for a sport-specific model of self-talk. Components of the model (i.e., self-talk, System 1, System 2, behaviour, contextual factors, personal factors) are presented, the reciprocal relationships among model components are explored, and implications of the sport-specific model of self-talk are discussed.},

Samples of squad and competitive athletes are underrepresented, although research has proven the positive effects of ST in the context of sports. Thus, the present study focused on the impact of ST on psychological and performance outcomes of junior sub-elite athletes. (2) Methods: N = 117 athletes (55 females, 62 males; M = 16.0 years) were randomly assigned to either one of two experimental groups or to a control group (n = 30). The experimental groups received an ST intervention for either one week (n = 36) or eight weeks (n = 38), and the control group received no ST training. The dependent variables (competitive anxiety, volitional skills, self-efficacy, and coaches' performance ratings) were assessed three times before and after the intervention. It was expected that (a) an ST intervention would reduce the competitive anxiety and increase volitional skills, self-efficacy, and performance; and, (b) long-term training would lead to higher effects than short-term training. (3) Results: As expected, ST training led to (less) somatic state anxiety and (higher) state self-confidence, self-optimization, self-efficacy, and performance. Additionally, long-term training was more effective than short-term training. (4) Conclusions: Targeted ST interventions may help to improve junior athletes' psychological states and performance.},

When there are few studies in particular, commonly used methods have several limitations, most notably of which is underestimating between-study variability. Although Bayesian methods are often recommended for small sample situations, their performance has not been thoroughly examined in the context of meta-analysis. Here, we characterize and apply weakly informative priors for estimating meta-analytic models and demonstrate with extensive simulations that fully Bayesian methods overcome boundary estimates of exactly zero between-study variance, better maintain error rates, and have lower frequentist risk according to Kullback-Leibler divergence. While our results show that combining evidence with few studies is non-trivial, we argue that this is an important goal that deserves further consideration in psychology. Further, we suggest that frequentist properties can provide important information for Bayesian modeling. We conclude with meta-analytic guidelines for applied researchers that can be implemented with the provided computer code.},

  abstract = {Experienced athletes use self-talk (ST) when challenged to monitor distress, to continue effort, and battle fatigue. The power clean, a training modality for power sports, challenges athletes to develop cognitive strategies to maintain performance, technique, and persist. A problem has been that ST studies have not measured perception of effort and muscle firing when ST is purposefully withheld. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ST to a control group during a session of power clean to fatigue. Also, multiple parameters were assessed and included perceptual, neural, and performance standards. The method of randomly assigned ST and control (CON) groups compared 24 experienced Olympic lifting men (age range 18 to 28 years). The groups completed continuous sets of power cleans for three repetitions at 85\% of maximum effort with a three-minute rest in between sets until failure. The ST group was instructed to engage in organic, goal-directed self-talk (ST group) during exercise. The CON group focused on a neutral attentional focus. The results demonstrated that the ST group achieved more sets, reps, and total weight lifted (p {$<$} 0.05). Both groups had comparable increases in perceived exertion prior to fatigue (p {$<$} 0.001). Persistence (numbers of sets and repetitions) after reaching the perceptual breakpoint (RPE of ``8'') was higher for the ST group (p {$<$}0.01) by 8.5 repetitions. Pain tolerance was slightly higher in the ST group as well. The ST group demonstrated lower activation in two muscle groups despite performing more work. In conclusion, ST enhanced performance by 43\% once an RPE of eight was reached, resulted in 63\% more repetitions, and demonstrated more efficient muscle activation patterns.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of instructional self-talk on performance and learning two basic skills of W.T.F Tae-kwon-do (Ap chagi and Bandae jireugi), in the perceived use of self-talk of novice athletes as well as in the possible correlation between the dimensions (effort, automaticity, cognitive and emotional control, self-confidence and attention) of the ``Functions of Self-Talk Questionnaire,-FSTQ'' (Theodorakis, Hatzigeorgiadis \&amp; Chroni, 2008). The sample consisted of 36 novice boys and girls, 8-12 years old (M=9.53, SD=1.53) and were randomly divided into two groups, the experimental (instructional self-talk group, N = 18) and the control group (N = 18). The intervention program lasted 8 weeks (2 sessions per week). Before starting the practice of skills, the participants spoke aloud specific key-words for the proper use of the technical skill. Participants were evaluated with a pre-test in the beginning of the program, a post-test at the end and one week after the final test they were evaluated in retention test. Moreover the evaluation of skill involved ten trials every skill, which were recorded by a digital camera and evaluated in five main elements of skill, by two observers. The result showed that the instructional self-talk was more effective for performance and learning the skills than the group that received feedback with traditional teaching. The use of instructional self-talk on younger athletes helped them to learn the skills but also to develop the psychological dimensions of the questionnaire (effort, automaticity, cognitive and emotional control, self-confidence and attention). Instructional self-talk can be an additional tool in the hands of the coach / physical education teacher for teaching and improving skill performances in other sports.},

  abstract = {The present study examined the effects of instructional and motivational self-talk on handball performance using a novel task (nondominant arm) and a learned task (dominant arm) in primary school students. Participants were randomly assigned into two experimental groups (instructional and motivational) and one control group. The results revealed that for both tasks instructional and motivational self-talk groups improved their performance significantly in comparison with the control group and that for the nondominant arm instructional self-talk had a larger effect compared with motivational self-talk. The results suggest that instructional self-talk in the form of external focused cues may be more beneficial in the early stages of learning.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of an instructional self-talk intervention on elementary students' (M age = 10.82 years, {$\pm$}0.72) motor performance in a soccer task. Participants were 45 elementary students who were randomly assigned into two groups one experimental and one control group. A three-day practice was administered to the two groups, with the experimental group using instructional self-talk. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that from baseline to final measure both groups improved their performance; however, the improvement of the self-talk group was larger compared with that of the control group. This resulted in the two groups displaying significant differences in the final measure (p {$<$} 0.01). In general, the results provided support for the beneficial effects of self-talk intervention programmes for task enhancement, and in particular show that such interventions can be effective from the ages of elementary school students.},
