The decision to specify instructional cues rather than providing participants with choice was due to the novelty of the experimental task. As participants had no prior experience in the task, they would not know which words to use, and providing task- specific training would have introduced a learning effect. Nevertheless, the choice of the instructional cues was based on previous piloting with an independent group where alternative options were tested. The duration of each subtest was approximately 4 min.  After the completion of the two tests, a standard manipulation check protocol (Hatzigeorgiadis et al., 2014) regarding the use of self-talk was administered to participants of the experimental and the control groups to ensure the integrity of the experimental conditions."
